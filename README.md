# starter-file 

I'm a self thought developer, I spend a lot of my time to making files for projects, this practise basically not good at for me.

## motivation 
At that particular time am doing in a  _nodejs_ project, surprisingly readed **express** documentation and i got that [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html), this package makes me curious and also asked myself **how can i make a custom one?** and a lot of research finally i created this. The project helped me to a better understand in how to use ***fs, path*** modules. Special thanks to [Harriet Ryder](https://medium.com/northcoders/creating-a-project-generator-with-node-29e13b3cd309) for a wonderful article.

##use 
make sure you have latest node & npm if you haven't. don't worry you can download it [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

type in your terminal for local installation
```
npm install starter-file
```
#####or 
you want it to be global, for any time you can generate it. simply put `-g` flag
```
npm install starter-file -g
```
